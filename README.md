# dsc360
In DSC - 360, I'm learning about OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in python, and use packages like Keras, Tensorflow and SKLearn to create, modify, and apply neural networks among different types of data.    

Currently, I'm doing some initial research on my final project, which looks to cover Brain Tumor Images, where I will be preforming neural networks in order to predict the type of tumors based on CAT  & MRI scans.
